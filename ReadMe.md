## Lesson-1-Interview Reading Questions
1. Explain the execution flow of a Java Program.

- Java sorce --> .java(Platform dependent)
- Compiled by the Java compiler(javac) -->  bytecode.class (Platform independent)
- JVM which has JI or JIT --> Security checks and interprets bytecode to machine language code (Platform dependent)
- OS --> Runs the machine code
2. What are source code and byte code files in Java? 

## Source Code (.java files):

Definition: Human-readable code written by developers using the Java programming language.
Purpose: Defines the logic, structure, and behavior of Java applications.

## Bytecode (.class files):

Definition: Platform-independent code generated by the Java compiler from source code.
Purpose: Executed by the JVM, allowing Java programs to run on any device with a compatible JVM.

3. Why is Java termed as a platform-neutral or independent language?
- "Write Once, Run Anywhere": Java programs are compiled into bytecode, which can run on any device equipped with a JVM.

4. What is the role of JRE?
- Java Runtime Environment (JRE):

Purpose: Provides the necessary libraries, Java Virtual Machine (JVM), and other components to run Java applications.
- Components:
  JVM: Executes Java bytecode.
  Libraries: Pre-built classes and packages that Java programs use.
  Other Files: Configuration and supporting files required for runtime.
### Key Point: The JRE does not include development tools like the compiler (javac); it's solely for running Java applications.

5. What are the components of JRE and its functionalities?
- Components of JRE:

- Java Virtual Machine (JVM):
Executes Java bytecode.
Manages memory through garbage collection.
- Core Libraries:
Provides essential classes and APIs (e.g., java.lang, java.util).
- Java Class Loader:
Loads classes into the JVM as needed.
- Java Runtime Libraries:
Include libraries for input/output, networking, security, and more.

## Functionalities:

- Execution Environment: Runs Java applications by interpreting or compiling bytecode.
- Memory Management: Automatically handles memory allocation and garbage collection.
- Security: Enforces security policies to protect against malicious code.
- Standard Libraries Support: Provides a vast set of reusable code to perform common tasks.

6. What is the importance of JIT?
- Just-In-Time (JIT) Compiler:

Purpose: Enhances the performance of Java applications by compiling bytecode into native machine code at runtime.
Functionality:
Dynamic Compilation: Converts frequently executed bytecode into optimized machine code on the fly.
Performance Boost: Reduces the execution time of Java programs by allowing the CPU to run native code directly.
Adaptive Optimization: Analyzes the running program and optimizes code paths that are used often.
Importance:

Speed: Significantly improves the execution speed of Java applications.
Efficiency: Makes Java competitive with natively compiled languages by optimizing runtime performance.
Resource Management: Balances compilation time with runtime performance to optimize overall application efficiency.

7. What is the difference between JVM, JRE, and JDK?
- Java Virtual Machine (JVM):

What It Is: A component that executes Java bytecode.
Function: Runs Java applications by interpreting or compiling bytecode into machine code.
Scope: Part of both JRE and JDK.

- Java Runtime Environment (JRE):

What It Is: A package that includes the JVM and essential libraries needed to run Java applications.
Function: Provides the environment required to execute Java programs.
Includes: JVM, core libraries, and supporting files.
Does Not Include: Development tools like compilers or debuggers.

- Java Development Kit (JDK):

What It Is: A full-featured kit for Java developers.
Function: Provides tools needed to develop, compile, debug, and run Java applications.
Includes: JRE (which contains JVM), compilers (javac), debuggers, and other development tools.
Summary:

JVM: Runs Java bytecode.
JRE: Contains JVM and libraries to run Java applications.
JDK: Contains JRE plus development tools to create Java applications.
